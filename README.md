# 🧮 Multi-Feature Python Calculator

- This is a simple and powerful command-line calculator written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with additional features like factorial, square root, interest calculations, reversing numbers, checking for primes, and more.
- I've also buit a seperate calculator using GUI Standard Library.
  
# 📌 Features

This calculator supports the following operations:

- 🔢 Basic Arithmetic:
  
      Addition

      Subtraction

      Multiplication

      Division (with zero check)

      Modulus

- 🧠 Mathematical Functions

      Power
    
      Square Root

      Factorial

      Logarithm (base e)

      Count number of digits

      Reverse a number

- 🔍 Number Checks

      Even or Odd

      Prime or Not

- 💰 Finance Calculations

      Simple Interest

      Compound Interest

# 🛠️ How It Works

     - The user selects an operation from the menu.

     - Inputs are taken based on the operation.

     - The result is calculated and displayed.

     - The program runs in a loop until the user selects "Exit".
     
# 💡 Future Enhancements

- History log of calculations

- Support for trigonometric functions



# GUI Calculator

- I've also buit a seperate calculator using GUI Standard Library.
